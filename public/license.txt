			     =================================
				 VERSION 1.0; 3 NOV 2010
						
	 Copyright (c) 2010 Wax Poetic Music, L.L.C. <http://waxpoeticrecords.com/>
	 All are permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
	 this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Large
	 parts of this document is inspired or lifted from Richard
	 Stallman's GNU General Public License, v3, for free and open
	 source software.
		
		
				    PREAMBLE

	The Wax Poetic General Public License is a free license for copyrighted and
	"open-sourced" music. While most mechanical and synchronization licenses are
	designed to limit or stifle your freedom to modify and improve existing works,
	the WAX GPL's purpose is to expand this freedom and enable everyone to have the
	same access to music that well-connected producers do. Wax Poetic Records
	includes "open-sourced" versions of all of its releases, and applies its
	concepts to all aspects of its business strategy. With this license, anyone who
	purchases an open-source copy of a Wax Poetic release is entitled to the audio
	stems of every song. These stems, split at the studio level, are high quality
	audio samples that can be freely used at any level in the audio production
	process.

	By "freely", we are referring to freedom, not price. This license guarantees you
	the right and the ability to obtain the source stems of every song you purchase
	from us, and the knowledge that such stems can be used royalty-free, without
	fear of future retribution. Wax Poetic does not charge royalties for the use of
	samples in songs we've distributed as part of the open source package. This
	license is designed to inform you of your rights as a producer, a listener, and
	an artist. It is also designed to inform you of how your derivative work is
	handled on every level of its journey from recording to publishing.
	

	                      TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	0. Definitions.

	 "This License" refers to version 1.0 of the Wax Poetic General Public License.

	 "Copyright" refers to the existing copyright laws regarding music on physical
	media. This also includes digital media audio/video files.

	 "The Work" refers to any copyrightable creative work released under this
	License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may
	be individuals or organizations.
	
	 "The Publisher" refers to the current publishing firm that administers
	Intellectual Property copyrights & trademarks as well as licensing of the
	work for use in other content (e.g. film). Although this License grants the
	record label of an artist who created a covered work complete rights to
	release said work, publishing rights are retained by the Publisher, who
	originally published the work to any major publishing rights society
	(e.g. ASCAP, BMI, etc.)

	 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
	in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
	exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "derivative" of the
	earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work. Derivative works may
	also be created from other derivative works.

	 A "covered work" means either the unmodified Work or a work based
	on the Work. Derivative works fall under this category.

	 To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
	permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
	infringement under applicable copyright law. Propagation includes
	copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available
	to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

	 To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
	parties to make or receive copies. Excluded from this definition are streaming
	media (including video counterparts) and peer-to-peer networks which also help
	propagate other pirated media.

	 1. Source.
	
	 The "Source Distribution" for a work includes all of the metadata files,
	project files, and audio samples required to open the project for this Work and
	execute the sequence. It may also include MIDI tracks and instrument/effect
	settings  stored within the project file. Distributions of the Source must be in
	OMF (Open Media Format), which can be opened by most major DAWs. For a list of
	DAWs that can open OMF projects, please visit:
		<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Media_Framework>
		
	 The Source Distribution can also include proprietary project formats for
	popular DAWs like Pro Tools, Logic Pro, Cubase, etc. However, Source
	Distribution projects must be identical in terms of feature set and
	the ability to manipulate the tracks within. In addition, PROPRIETARY
	SOFTWARE INSTRUMENTS AND EFFECTS (that are not licensed free/libre/open source
	software), ARE PROHIBITED from Source Distribution project files. In most
	cases, it would be better practice to bounce each track seperately and include
	audio samples of the sounds. This decreases the ability to manipulate the
	track's sound (e.g. by changing a certain setting on the software instrument),
	but "levels the playing field" for users who have not purchased these
	software instruments and still wish to utilize the content in this Source
	Distribution.	

	 The Corresponding Source for a work in an OMF project is that same work.

	 2. Basic Permissions.

	 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
	copyright on the Work, and are irrevocable provided the stated
	conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
	permission to run the unmodified Work.  The output from running a
	covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
	content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
	rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
	
	 You may listen to, remix, and propagate covered works that you do not
	convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in
	force. You may convey the works you create, as well as the original Work,
	using legitimate music distribution networks. You may convey covered works to
	others for the sole purpose of having them modify the work exclusively for you,
	or provide you with facilities for performing those works live, provided that
	you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you
	do not control copyright. Those thus creating, performing or otherwise executing
	the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your
	direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
	your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
	
	 Upon a request for publication, you surrender all publishing and licensing
	rights to the Publisher. By using elements of this Work's Corresponding
	Source, or the entire Source outright, you forfeit the legal right to self
	publish your work or publish under another firm. Furthermore, any attempts
	to publish your work without notifying the Publisher beforehand is
	considered a breach of contract in terms of this License. THE TERMS AND
	CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE GRANT THE PUBLISHER EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO THE
	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CONTAINED WITHIN, AS WELL AS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE
	WHETHER TO ENFORCE THEIR PUBLISHING RIGHTS IN A COURT OF LAW.

	 Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
	the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
	makes it unnecessary.

	 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

	 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
	measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
	11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
	similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
	measures.

	 When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
	circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
	is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
	the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
	modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
	users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
	technological measures.

	 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
	
	 You may convey verbatim copies of the Work's source code as you
	receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
	appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
	keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
	terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the source; and give all
	recipients a copy of this License along with the Work.

	 YOU MAY NOT CHARGE A PRICE FOR SIMPLY CONVEYING A COPY OF THIS WORK.

	 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

	 You may convey a work based on the Work, or the modifications to
	produce it from the Work, in the form of source code under the
	terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

	   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
	   it, and giving a relevant date.

	   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
	   released under this License and any conditions added under section
	   7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
	   "keep intact all notices".

	   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
	   License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
	   License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
	   additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
	   regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
	   permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
	   invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

	   d) If the covered work is being released under a 3rd-party label
	   or other distribution network, the terms of release must be aligned
	   with the terms stated in this License.

	 A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
	works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
	and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger Work,
	in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
	"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
	used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
	beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
	in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
	parts of the aggregate.

	 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

	 You may convey a covered work based on the Work under the terms
	of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the Corresponding Source
	under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

	   a) Convey the covered work in, or embodied in, a physical product
	   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
	   Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
	   customarily used for media storage.

	   b) Convey the covered work in, or embodied in, a physical product
	   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
	   written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
	   long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
	   model, to give anyone who possesses the Work a copy of the Corresponding
		Source for all the Works in the product that is covered by this License, on
		a durable physical medium customarily used for media storage, for a price no
		more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of
		source (e.g shipping & handling).

	 A "User Product" is the release package that this Work was bundled in.
	Literally, a User Product is a "consumer product", which means any
	tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
	or household purposes. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
	doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
	product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
	typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
	of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
	actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
	is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
	commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
	the only significant mode of use of the product.

	 7. Additional Terms.

	 "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
	License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
	Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Work shall
	be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
	that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
	apply only to part of the Work, that part may be used separately
	under those permissions, but the entire Work remains governed by
	this License without regard to the additional permissions.

	 When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
	remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
	it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
	removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
	additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
	for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

	 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
	add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
	that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

	   a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
	   terms of section 15 of this License; or

	   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
	   author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
	   Notices displayed by works containing it; or

	   c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
	   requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
	   reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

	   d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
	   authors of the material; or

	   e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
	   trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

	   f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
	   material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
	   it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
	   any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
	   those licensors and authors.
	
		g) Publishing under a 3rd-party publisher, wherein the Publisher,
		the label by which the covered work has been released, the label by
		which the original Work has been released, and the Artist have all
		agreed to an identical publishing contract.

	 All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
	restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Work as you
	received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
	governed by this License along with a term that is a further
	restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
	a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
	License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
	of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
	not survive such relicensing or conveying.

	 If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
	must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
	additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
	where to find the applicable terms.

	 Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
	form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
	the above requirements apply either way.

	 8. Termination.

	 You may not propagate, publish or modify a covered work except as
	expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate
	or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
	this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
	paragraph of section 11). Termination of copyright is final and can only
	be overturned with a written agreement from the Publisher.

	 Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
	licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
	this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
	reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
	material under section 10.

	 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

	 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
	run a copy of the Work.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
	occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
	to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
	nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
	modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
	not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
	covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

	 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

	 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
	receives a license from the original licensors, to experience, modify and
	propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
	for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

	 An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
	organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
	organization, or merging organizations (e.g., merging record labels or
	publishers). If propagation of a covered work results from an entity
	transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work
	also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in
	interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to
	possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
	interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

	 You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
	rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
	not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
	rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
	(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
	any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
	sale, or importing the Work or any portion of it.

	 11. Patents.

	 A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
	License of the Work or a work on which the Work is based.  The
	work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

	 A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
	owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
	hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
	by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
	but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
	consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
	purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
	patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
	this License.

	 Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
	license under the contributor's essential IP claims, to make, use,
	sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate
	the contents of its contributor version.

	 In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
	agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
	(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
	sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
	party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
	patent against the party.

	 If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
	and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
	to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
	publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
	then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
	available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
	patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
	consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
	license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
	actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
	covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
	in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
	country that you have reason to believe are valid.

	 If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
	arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
	covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
	receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
	or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
	you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
	work and works based on it.

	 A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
	the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
	conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
	specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
	work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
	in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
	to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
	the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
	parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
	patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
	conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
	for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
	contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
	or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

	 Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
	any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
	otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

	 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

	 If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
	covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
	not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
	to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
	the Work, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
	License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Work.

	 13. Revised Versions of this License.

	 Wax Poetic Music, L.L.C. may publish revised and/or new versions of the WAX General
	Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit
	to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
	concerns.

	 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
	Work specifies that a certain numbered version of the WAX General
	Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
	option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
	version or of any later version published by Wax Poetic Music, L.L.C. If the Work does
	not specify a version number of the WAX General Public License, you may choose
	any version ever published by Wax Poetic Music, L.L.C.

	 If the Work specifies that a proxy can decide which future
	versions of the WAX General Public License can be used, that proxy's
	public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
	to choose that version for the Work.

	 Later license versions may give you additional or different
	permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
	author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
	later version.

	 14. Limitation of Liability.

	 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
	WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
	THE WORK AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
	GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
	USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WORK (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSSES
	SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS
	BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

	 If the limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal
	effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that
	most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
	connection with the Work, unless a warranty or assumption of liability
	accompanies a copy of the Work in return for a fee.

	

	                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
	
	
				  HOW TO APPLY THESE TERMS TO YOUR OWN WORKS
				
	If you would like to open-source your music, or release new music freely
	and openly, the best way would be to display the following somewhere around
	the recording's download page, or in the description for it if you've
	uploaded it somewhere. This brief referendum must also be included in a
	viewable place within the booklet (for physical releases). You are also required
	to include the full text of this license somewhere in the packaging or
	distribution of this Work.
