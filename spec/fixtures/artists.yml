  bio: "Two years ago, longtime friends [The Architech](http://soundcloud.com/iamthearchitech)
    and [Tom Phoolery](http://thewonderbars.com) made a pact to begin producing tracks
    together. Sharing common interests in sound engineering and musical taste, they
    began making \"experiments\", tracks that touched both on Architech's experiences
    as a hardcore/jungle DJ as well as Tom's experience fronting a live house band.
    Together, their influences touch both on the more \"classic\" styles of dance
    music as well as new developments in the scene. The music they create is reminiscent
    of a time when electronic music was more melodic, but retains the raw energy that
    recent technology has empowered us to use in modern music production.\r\n\r\n-
    **The Architech:** programming, drum machines\r\n- **Tom Phoolery:** programming,
    vocals"
