  description: "\n\nA free download from Research and Development to promote...something...stay
    tuned!\r\n\r\n#### This is Shuffle Not, our remix of [Suffer Not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dblnSABZp0)
    by Submotion Orchestra\r\n\r\nA truly beautiful piece, we never intended to release
    this version but after much deliberation, tweaking, and secret live performances...we
    noticed that almost everyone who listened to it really enjoyed the work. The only
    sample from Suffer Not is the open vocals, everything else has either been re-produced
    or edited by one of us. After even more deliberation, we decided that all great
    things in life should be free and gave it to YOU, to download FOR FREE!\r\n\r\nYou
    can find the download link on this release's **Soundcloud page**: <http://soundcloud.com/resndev/shuffle-not/>
    \r\n\r\n#### Enjoy!!\n\n# Track List\n\n1. Shuffle Not"
